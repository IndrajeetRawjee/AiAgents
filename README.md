# ü§ñ AI Coding Agent with Gemini

This project is a demonstration of building an autonomous **AI coding agent** using Google‚Äôs Gemini API, inspired by the *freeCodeCamp Guide to Agentic AI ‚Äì Build a Python Coding Agent with Gemini* tutorial.

***

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer ‚Äì Use With Caution

**This agent can write, read, and modify files, and execute code without human oversight. It does _not_ have any built-in security guardrails, sandboxing, or input validation. It is possible‚Äîintentionally or accidentally‚Äîfor the agent to overwrite important files, introduce vulnerabilities, remove data, leak confidential information, or download/execute malicious code.**

- **Do not use with sensitive, production, or critical data.**
- **Do not expose API keys, credentials, or private codebases.**
- **Review all code and actions suggested or performed by this tool before permitting them to run or commit.**
- **Never approve or automate actions you haven‚Äôt verified.**
- **Understand the operational and security risks before trying agentic AI tools.**

***

### ‚ú® Features

- Accepts **natural language prompts** and generates safe Python code (when used carefully)
- Employs **step-by-step reasoning** and iterative improvement
- Built with **Python 3.10+** and the official Gemini API

***

### üöÄ Getting Started

#### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-coding-agent.git
cd ai-coding-agent
```

#### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Set Gemini API Key
Create a `.env` file:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

#### 5. Run the Agent
```bash
python agent.py
```

### üõ° Security Advice

- Always run and test the agent in a **restricted, isolated environment** (like a disposable VM or secure container).
- **Manually review** and sanity check generated code or any filesystem changes suggested before use.
- Do _not_ grant unnecessary OS or network permissions.
- Keep credentials, secrets, and critical assets away from any agent-controlled directory or context.
- Stay aware of prompt injection risks and adversarial inputs; the agent can be manipulated by crafted instructions.

***

### üì¶ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Gemini API**
- **dotenv**
- **requests/httpx**

***

### üß† Learning Focus

- Agentic AI design and the risks of autonomous code generation
- The necessity for _careful human review_ of all agent actions
- Secure, ethical adoption of AI tools in development
